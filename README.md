# Maze Mapping Robot
## Fall 2017: ECE 3400 

This robot was assembled, wired, and programmed to navigate a maze using a depth-first search algorithm.
The maze was composed of wooden planks for walls that were placed on top of a black lined grid on the floor. 
The robot used the grid when line following to stay within aisles of the maze and to avoid collisions with walls.
Wall locations, obtained by the robot's proximity sensors, were wirelessly transmitted to an FPGA Display
which would show the current position of the robot in the maze.
